A curated collection of fonts commonly used or available on Vivo smartphones (Funtouch OS / Origin OS). This repository includes custom fonts, official Vivo typefaces, and popular alternatives for users who want to customize their device fonts via tools like zFont, theme apps, or manual installation.

## Purpose

Vivo devices often have limited font customization options in newer versions of Funtouch OS. This collection gathers `.ttf` and `.otf` font files to help users:
- Apply custom fonts using third-party apps (e.g., zFont).
- Experiment with different typefaces for a personalized look.
- Access fonts similar to those in the official Vivo Theme Store.

**Note:** All fonts here are collected from open-source or freely available sources. Please respect font licenses and use them responsibly.

## Contents

- Font files organized in folders by style or source (e.g., `/sans-serif`, `/handwritten`, `/official-vivo`).
- Preview images (if available) showing how fonts render on devices.
- Instructions for installation on Vivo/iQOO devices.

## How to Use

### On Vivo Devices (Funtouch OS / Origin OS)
1. Download the desired `.ttf` file.
2. Use an app like [zFont](https://zfont.github.io/) to apply the font (may require downgrading the Themes app on newer Android versions).
3. Alternatively, follow community guides on Reddit (e.g., r/Vivo) for manual installation via APK or theme methods.

**Warning:** Changing system fonts may require root or specific workarounds. Proceed at your own risk — no guarantees on compatibility or stability.

### Preview Fonts
You can install the fonts on your computer to preview them:
- Windows: Right-click → Install
- macOS: Double-click → Install Font
- Linux: Copy to `~/.fonts` and refresh cache
